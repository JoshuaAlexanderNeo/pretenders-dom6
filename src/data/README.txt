The data files in this directory are almost all auto-generated. Any
errors in the nations and pretenders data are therefore almost certainly
a result of either:

1. Errors in the source data, taken from the Dom 5 Inspector or, 
2. more likely, errors in the conversion of those data to .json format,
   done by the translation script "pull_inspector_data.rb".

Errors should be found and fixed there. Please report any!

One exception to this is the base cost of pretenders, which is saved and
edited by hand. Any errors in pretender_costs.json should be fixed
directly there.
